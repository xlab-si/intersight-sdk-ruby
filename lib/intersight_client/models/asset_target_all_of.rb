#Cisco Intersight

#Cisco Intersight is a management platform delivered as a service with embedded analytics for your Cisco and 3rd party IT infrastructure. This platform offers an intelligent level of management that enables IT organizations to analyze, simplify, and automate their environments in more advanced ways than the prior generations of tools. Cisco Intersight provides an integrated and intuitive management experience for resources in the traditional data center as well as at the edge. With flexible deployment options to address complex security needs, getting started with Intersight is quick and easy. Cisco Intersight has deep integration with Cisco UCS and HyperFlex systems allowing for remote deployment, configuration, and ongoing maintenance. The model-based deployment works for a single system in a remote location or hundreds of systems in a data center and enables rapid, standardized configuration and deployment. It also streamlines maintaining those systems whether you are working with small or very large configurations. The Intersight OpenAPI document defines the complete set of properties that are returned in the HTTP response. From that perspective, a client can expect that no additional properties are returned, unless these properties are explicitly defined in the OpenAPI document. However, when a client uses an older version of the Intersight OpenAPI document, the server may send additional properties because the software is more recent than the client. In that case, the client may receive properties that it does not know about. Some generated SDKs perform a strict validation of the HTTP response body against the OpenAPI document. This document was created on 2021-10-20T11:22:53Z.

    attr_accessor :ip_address

    # The location from which Intersight manages the target. * `Unknown` - The management mechanism is not detected. Unknown is used as a default by the implementation and is not an allowed user input. * `Intersight` - Management of a target is performed directly from Intersight. Network connections are established from Intersight to a management interface of the Target and authenticated using user provided credentials. * `IntersightAssist` - Management of a target is performed via a selected Intersight Assist. Network connections are established from the Intersight Assist to a management interface of the Target. * `DeviceConnector` - An Intersight Device Connector running within the Target establishes a connection to Intersight and management of the target is performed via this connection.

    # Status indicates if Intersight can establish a connection and authenticate with the managed target. Status does not include information about the functional health of the target. * `` - The target details have been persisted but Intersight has not yet attempted to connect to the target. * `Connected` - Intersight is able to establish a connection to the target and initiate management activities. * `NotConnected` - Intersight is unable to establish a connection to the target. * `ClaimInProgress` - Claim of the target is in progress. A connection to the target has not been fully established. * `Unclaimed` - The device was un-claimed from the users account by an Administrator of the device. Also indicates the failure to claim Targets of type HTTP Endpoint in Intersight. * `Claimed` - Target of type HTTP Endpoint is successfully claimed in Intersight. Currently no validation is performed to verify the Target connectivity from Intersight at the time of creation. However invoking API from Intersight Orchestrator fails if this Target is not reachable from Intersight or if Target API credentials are incorrect.
