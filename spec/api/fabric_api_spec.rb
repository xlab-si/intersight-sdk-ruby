#Cisco Intersight

#Cisco Intersight is a management platform delivered as a service with embedded analytics for your Cisco and 3rd party IT infrastructure. This platform offers an intelligent level of management that enables IT organizations to analyze, simplify, and automate their environments in more advanced ways than the prior generations of tools. Cisco Intersight provides an integrated and intuitive management experience for resources in the traditional data center as well as at the edge. With flexible deployment options to address complex security needs, getting started with Intersight is quick and easy. Cisco Intersight has deep integration with Cisco UCS and HyperFlex systems allowing for remote deployment, configuration, and ongoing maintenance. The model-based deployment works for a single system in a remote location or hundreds of systems in a data center and enables rapid, standardized configuration and deployment. It also streamlines maintaining those systems whether you are working with small or very large configurations. The Intersight OpenAPI document defines the complete set of properties that are returned in the HTTP response. From that perspective, a client can expect that no additional properties are returned, unless these properties are explicitly defined in the OpenAPI document. However, when a client uses an older version of the Intersight OpenAPI document, the server may send additional properties because the software is more recent than the client. In that case, the client may receive properties that it does not know about. Some generated SDKs perform a strict validation of the HTTP response body against the OpenAPI document. This document was created on 2021-10-20T11:22:53Z.

  # unit tests for create_fabric_appliance_pc_role
  # Create a &#39;fabric.AppliancePcRole&#39; resource.
  # @param fabric_appliance_pc_role The &#39;fabric.AppliancePcRole&#39; resource to create.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :if_match For methods that apply server-side changes, and in particular for PUT, If-Match can be used to prevent the lost update problem. It can check if the modification of a resource that the user wants to upload will not override another change that has been done since the original resource was fetched. If the request cannot be fulfilled, the 412 (Precondition Failed) response is returned. When modifying a resource using POST or PUT, the If-Match header must be set to the value of the resource ModTime property after which no lost update problem should occur. For example, a client send a GET request to obtain a resource, which includes the ModTime property. The ModTime indicates the last time the resource was created or modified. The client then sends a POST or PUT request with the If-Match header set to the ModTime property of the resource as obtained in the GET request.
  # @option opts [String] :if_none_match For methods that apply server-side changes, If-None-Match used with the * value can be used to create a resource not known to exist, guaranteeing that another resource creation didn&#39;t happen before, losing the data of the previous put. The request will be processed only if the eventually existing resource&#39;s ETag doesn&#39;t match any of the values listed. Otherwise, the status code 412 (Precondition Failed) is used. The asterisk is a special value representing any resource. It is only useful when creating a resource, usually with PUT, to check if another resource with the identity has already been created before. The comparison with the stored ETag uses the weak comparison algorithm, meaning two resources are considered identical if the content is equivalent - they don&#39;t have to be identical byte for byte.

  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :if_match For methods that apply server-side changes, and in particular for PUT, If-Match can be used to prevent the lost update problem. It can check if the modification of a resource that the user wants to upload will not override another change that has been done since the original resource was fetched. If the request cannot be fulfilled, the 412 (Precondition Failed) response is returned. When modifying a resource using POST or PUT, the If-Match header must be set to the value of the resource ModTime property after which no lost update problem should occur. For example, a client send a GET request to obtain a resource, which includes the ModTime property. The ModTime indicates the last time the resource was created or modified. The client then sends a POST or PUT request with the If-Match header set to the ModTime property of the resource as obtained in the GET request.
  # @option opts [String] :if_none_match For methods that apply server-side changes, If-None-Match used with the * value can be used to create a resource not known to exist, guaranteeing that another resource creation didn&#39;t happen before, losing the data of the previous put. The request will be processed only if the eventually existing resource&#39;s ETag doesn&#39;t match any of the values listed. Otherwise, the status code 412 (Precondition Failed) is used. The asterisk is a special value representing any resource. It is only useful when creating a resource, usually with PUT, to check if another resource with the identity has already been created before. The comparison with the stored ETag uses the weak comparison algorithm, meaning two resources are considered identical if the content is equivalent - they don&#39;t have to be identical byte for byte.

For example, a client send a GET request to obtain a resource, which includes the ModTime property. The ModTime indicates the last time the resource was created or modified. The client then sends a POST or PUT request with the If-Match header set to the ModTime property of the resource as obtained in the GET request.
  # @option opts [String] :if_none_match For methods that apply server-side changes, If-None-Match used with the * value can be used to create a resource not known to exist, guaranteeing that another resource creation didn&#39;t happen before, losing the data of the previous put. The request will be processed only if the eventually existing resource&#39;s ETag doesn&#39;t match any of the values listed. Otherwise, the status code 412 (Precondition Failed) is used. The asterisk is a special value representing any resource. It is only useful when creating a resource, usually with PUT, to check if another resource with the identity has already been created before. The comparison with the stored ETag uses the weak comparison algorithm, meaning two resources are considered identical if the content is equivalent - they don&#39;t have to be identical byte for byte.

The \&quot;$apply\&quot; query takes a sequence of set transformations, separated by forward slashes to express that they are consecutively applied, i.e. the result of each transformation is the input to the next transformation. Supported aggregation methods are \&quot;aggregate\&quot; and \&quot;groupby\&quot;. The **aggregate** transformation takes a comma-separated list of one or more aggregate expressions as parameters and returns a result set with a single instance, representing the aggregated value for all instances in the input set. The **groupby** transformation takes one or two parameters and 1. Splits the initial set into subsets where all instances in a subset have the same values for the grouping properties specified in the first parameter, 2. Applies set transformations to each subset according to the second parameter, resulting in a new set of potentially different structure and cardinality, 3. Ensures that the instances in the result set contain all grouping properties with the correct values for the group, 4. Concatenates the intermediate result sets into one result set. A groupby transformation affects the structure of the result set.
