# IntersightClient::VirtualizationBaseVirtualNetworkInterfaceCard

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **class_id** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. |  |
| **object_type** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. |  |
| **adapter_type** | **String** | Type or model of the virtual network interface card. * &#x60;Unknown&#x60; - The type of the network adaptor type is unknown. * &#x60;E1000&#x60; - Emulated version of the Intel 82545EM Gigabit Ethernet NIC. * &#x60;SRIOV&#x60; - Representation of a virtual function (VF) on a physical NIC with SR-IOV support. * &#x60;VMXNET2&#x60; - VMXNET 2 (Enhanced) is available only for some guest operating systems on ESX/ESXi 3.5 and later. * &#x60;VMXNET3&#x60; - VMXNET 3 offers all the features available in VMXNET 2 and adds several new features. * &#x60;E1000E&#x60; - E1000E – emulates a newer real network adapter, the 1 Gbit Intel 82574, and is available for Windows 2012 and later. The E1000E needs virtual machine hardware version 8 or later. * &#x60;NE2K_PCI&#x60; - The Ne2000 network card uses two ring buffers for packet handling. These are circular buffers made of 256-byte pages that the chip&#39;s DMA logic will use to store received packets or to get received packets. * &#x60;PCnet&#x60; - The PCnet-PCI II is a PCI network adapter. It has built-in support for CRC checks and can automatically pad short packets to the minimum Ethernet length. * &#x60;RTL8139&#x60; - The RTL8139 is a fast Ethernet card that operates at 10/100 Mbps. It is compliant with PCI version 2.0/2.1 and it is known for reliability and superior performance. * &#x60;VirtIO&#x60; - VirtIO is a standardized interface which allows virtual machines access to simplified \&quot;virtual\&quot; devices, such as block devices, network adapters and consoles. Accessing devices through VirtIO on a guest VM improves performance over more traditional \&quot;emulated\&quot; devices, as VirtIO devices require only the bare minimum setup and configuration needed to send and receive data, while the host machine handles the majority of the setup and maintenance of the actual physical hardware. * &#x60;&#x60; - Default network adaptor type supported by the hypervisor. | [optional][default to &#39;Unknown&#39;] |
| **mac_address** | **String** | MAC address assigned to the virtual network interface card. | [optional] |
| **name** | **String** | Name of the virtual network interface card. | [optional] |
